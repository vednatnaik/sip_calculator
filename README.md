sip calculator is used to calculate the sip for yearly returns and monthly returns

# why 
I been a share market investor faced a problem to  calculate the returns I have on monthly basis as as the calculators avaliable online calculate yearly intrest rate and in share market we dony have a fixed anullay intrest rate. So I developed a calculator that calculates my monthly investment and returns.
